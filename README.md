# api-spec

Auto-generated OpenAPI specifications for Text2Motion API server. You can use this spec to build any clients that currently aren't being auto-generated.

See [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation/) for instructions to install the OpenAPI CLI. Once you have the CLI, you can simply invoke the cli like so to generate a client. An example invocation to generate a Python client is shown below.

`openapi-generator-cli generate -i /local/$OPEN_API_SPEC_PATH -g python -o /local/out/python`

The clients that we have currently generated and tested are below. YMMV for others.

| csharp                                                 |   yes   |     none     |
| cpp-ue4                                                | minimal |     none     |
| typescript-node                                        |   yes   |     none     |

Please create an issue [here](https://github.com/text2motion/api-spec/issues) for issues with the spec or inability to generate an already supported client.
